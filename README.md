# Formula 1 - Breaking Down the 2024 Season
📊 A Data-Driven Analysis Using FastF1

## Overview
This project provides an in-depth analysis of the **2024 Formula 1 season** using **Python** and the **FastF1** library. The goal is to break down key statistics, race results, and performance trends through **data visualizations and insights**.<br>
Using **official telemetry and session data**, this notebook covers:<br>
✅ Race and sprint locations 📍<br>
✅ Driver & team performances 🏆<br>
✅ Lap times, fastest laps, and consistency metrics ⏱️<br>
✅ DNFs and their causes ❌<br>
✅ Impact of weather on race outcomes 🌦️<br>

## Data Source & Tools
**FastF1** 🏎️ – Official F1 data retrieval (session results, telemetry, weather, etc.).<br>
**Pandas** 🐍 – Data manipulation and analysis.<br>
**Matplotlib & Seaborn** 📊 – Data visualization.<br>
**Plotly** 🎨 – Interactive charts.<br>
**Folium** 🗺️ – Mapping race & sprint locations.
